A customizable toggle switch/slider used to control visibility of other blocks on the page.

== Description ==

The Toggle Anything block allows you to control visibility of other blocks on the page via user interaction.
A common example is a pricing page where a user can toggle between monthly vs yearly subscription pricing. With this plugin allows you to design your own pricing tables using core blocks, then control the which items are visible or hidden when the switch is toggled.

* Multiple design configurations for each toggle.
* Option for adding text in on/off positions.
